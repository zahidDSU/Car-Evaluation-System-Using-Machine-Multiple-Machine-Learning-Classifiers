# Car-Evaluation-System-Using-Machine-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Classifiers

Car Evaluation System
Project Overview
The "Car Evaluation System" is a data analysis and machine learning project that focuses on categorizing cars based on various attributes. It utilizes a dataset of 1728 car entries, each with seven attributes, including buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, safety features, and a final label categorizing the car.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 1728 car entries, each representing a specific car model. It includes information on various car attributes, helping users evaluate cars based on predefined criteria.

Columns in the Dataset
buying: Buying price category.
maint: Maintenance cost category.
doors: Number of doors.
persons: Passenger capacity.
lug_boot: Luggage boot size.
safety: Safety features.
label: Categorizes cars as "unacceptable," "acceptable," "good," or "very good."
